so, what is freehost (freemc) ?

well like every other person that has more server power than they need, i'm deciding to put it to good use. i'm letting people host minecraft servers on it. i mean fair enough right, because for example, hackclubs nest, doesn't allow you to host anything too memory or cpu intesive.

i've essentially hooked up a panel made with nextjs to pterodactyl, which is good n all, there are some caveats but it works most of the time.

ok thx byeee
